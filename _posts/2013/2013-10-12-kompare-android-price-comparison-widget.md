The kompare price comparison widget was released to the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.mediavrog.kompare">Play Store</a> just a few days ago.

I created this widget within 2 months of programming after work as a small project to get to know how widgets work on android. I really want to move on to build a real app, as widgets can be a real pain in the a** :) Anyway I think the result is find - it's working and looks nice. Give it a try and save some money while grocery shopping.

Find all the details at <a href="http://mediavrog.net/blog/project/kompare/">the project page</a>.
