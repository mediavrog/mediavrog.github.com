> The Javascript Framework mootools recently hit the &#8222;advance&#8220; button and so mootools 1.2 was published! It comes along with great new features and speed improvements.



For your coding pleasure, i just updated my cheat sheet to the new revision. It includes cheat sheet like documentation for **Core, Native, Class, Element, Utilities and Request**. I&#8217;ll launch **another cheatsheet which will cover FX and Plugins** soon.

Enjoy!
