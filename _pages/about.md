I'm a communicative person with a structured and creative open mind. I love how ubiquitous computing changes and enhances our daily life and therefore want to be part of the innovation and creation of new mobile services. I personally see mobile health becoming more and more important especially in the emerging markets.

I always keep a critical stance to the code I read and write, and am never afraid of digging into unknown and my own code to refactor it. Using tickets and versioning systems is as much part of my daily work as documenting and striving to produce easily understandable and readable, well commented code. I am not a big fan of a low bus factor.
