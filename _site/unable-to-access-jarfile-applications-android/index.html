When trying to run ProGuard from Android Studio (for example during the process of building a signed Application), the following error may pop up.</p>

<p>Error [ProjectName] Unable to access jarfile /Applications/Android</p>

<p>This is most likely caused in an environment, where Android Studio is installed in a path containing whitespaces and the called proguard script cannot handle whitespaces in the path. On my Mac workmachine, I installed Android Studio at:</p>

<p>/Applications/Android Studio.app</p>

<p>The solution is as simple as editing</p>

<p>/Applications/Android Studio.app/sdk/tools/proguard/bin/proguard.sh</p>

<p>and changing</p>

<p>java -jar $PROGUARD_HOME/lib/proguard.jar “$@”</p>

<p>to</p>

<p>java -jar “$PROGUARD_HOME/lib/proguard.jar” “$@”</p>
