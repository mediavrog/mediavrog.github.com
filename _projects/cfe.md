> Custom Form Elements unites all efforts in the web to enhance web-based XHTML forms in terms of style, usability and accessibility by using Javascript and/or CSS.
> It's a forms ui library.

I started out developing this from a small script I build for a friend who needed cross browser styled checkboxes.
Eventually I modularized the components and build them into one single library based on mootools. On thing I always
paid attention to (and which differentiates this library from others) is accessibility: All inputs as well as the 
styled decoration layer react to mouse as well as standard keyboard events and are fully functional just as the original form elements.

With the rise of bootstrap and other FE CSS/HTML frameworks this library has become obsolete.
