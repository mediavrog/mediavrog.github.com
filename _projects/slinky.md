> After talking with my colleague JB, we found that it is hard to keep
track of all the links shared on Slack. We have a lot of channels for
different projects and teams, and useful resources are shared all over 
the place. Slinky tackles this problem by connecting to Slack and
importing and organising the links automatically. Team members can 
access the links any time and sort, filter and search them.
 &mdash; <a href="https://slinkybot.com/" class="btn btn-success">Slinky - your links organised</a>

EVER TRIED TO FIND THAT USEFUL ARTICLE YOUR COWORKER SHARED 4 DAYS AGO?  ðŸ‘º

Used the Slack search but no gain? Asked your coworker but he didn't
 remember which channel he shared in in? You are not alone! 
 Communication in Slack can be overwhelming and keeping track of 
 all the interesting articles and links is sometimes daunting.

BORN OUT OF THIS FRUSTRATION IS SLINKY  ðŸŒˆ

Once added to Slack, Slinky will listen to links posted in the channels
 you invited it to. It carefully picks them along with emoji reactions
  to craft your company's board of links.

Use emoji reactions like  ðŸ“Ž  * to save a link to read later and Slinky will keep it warm just for you.
