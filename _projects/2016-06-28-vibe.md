We started Vibe because we believe that good work happens with a good team. But like in any team, there are ups and downs.
 Vibe is a simple tool which allows managers and team members to monitor the mood across several metrics like Happiness, Excitement, Hostility, Withdrawal, or Engagement. 
 Your team can now try to overcome problems before they arise, and celebrate the highs.

Weâ€™re still in beta but all our beta users love us and give us great feedback. 
We would love to have you sign up, tell us how it benefits your team and hear your comments. 
We're working hard to respond to each of you who reached out to us, and if you're interested in checking out 
Vibe - please sign up
